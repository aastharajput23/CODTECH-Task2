## Overview of the Project

### Project: Python program for STUDENT GRADE TRACKER .

### Objective : 
The objective of creating a **Student Grade Tracker** in Python is to develop a system that efficiently records, calculates, and tracks student grades across various subjects or assignments, automates grade calculations (such as averages and letter grades), and provides insights into student performance. It aims to enhance programming skills, data management, and error handling while offering flexibility, user-friendliness, and optional data persistence for long-term use..

### Key Activities 
-**Define Requirements**: Identify features like grade input, calculation, and reporting.
-**Design Data Structure**: Choose appropriate structures (lists, dictionaries) to store student data.
-**Create Grade Calculation Functions**: Develop functions to compute averages, letter grades, and GPA.
-**Handle User Input**: Implement input validation for student names, subjects, and grades.
-**Display Results**: Show student grades, averages, and letter grades in a readable format.
-**Implement Error Handling**: Handle invalid inputs and out-of-range values.


### Technology used
-**Python**: Core programming language.
-**Control Structures**: if, else loop
-**Data Structures(Lists, Dictionaries)**: For storing student names, subjects, and grades.
-**Functions**: To perform calculations like averages, letter grades, and GPA.
-**Input/Output (input(), print())**: For collecting data and displaying results to the user.
